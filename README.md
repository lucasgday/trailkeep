# trailkeep

**Keep your AI coding history — private, browsable, and yours.**

**🇬🇧 English · 🇪🇸 [Español](README.es.md)**

A local home for your conversations with your AI coding tools — whichever you
use. Keep the decisions and context your code doesn't record, find any of it
later, and pick up where you left off. Nothing ever leaves your machine.

This project reads where each tool stores its sessions on your disk, converts
them into readable Markdown with standard metadata, and gives you a standalone
HTML viewer to browse, group, filter and see analytics of your usage.

Everything runs **locally on your Mac**. Nothing is uploaded anywhere. The viewer
UI is **bilingual (English / Spanish)** with a language toggle.

**▶ [Try the live demo](https://lucasgday.github.io/trailkeep/)** — the viewer
running in your browser with sample data, so you can see how it works. It
**uploads nothing**.

## Why

**Your AI coding chats hold the decisions and the *why* behind how you built
things — context your code never records. But it lives locked in each tool's own
format, hard to revisit, and your tools don't keep it forever:**

- **Claude Code** cleans up old transcripts after a while (by default, based on
  last activity). It's **configurable**: raising `cleanupPeriodDays` in
  `~/.claude/settings.json` extends retention a lot, or effectively disables it.
  But if you never touched it, you're on the default and old sessions disappear.
- **Codex** stores local session files, but the app's project/sidebar grouping
  can change over time. A Markdown backup gives you a stable, searchable copy
  outside the app UI.
- Each tool has its own policy, format and scope. And if you reinstall, switch
  machines, run an `rm` or a database gets corrupted, that history is gone
  **without warning** and without a trash bin.

> **Honest note:** if you use *only* Claude Code and raise `cleanupPeriodDays`,
> much of the automatic deletion stops being a problem. Even so, trailkeep still
> gives you what a retention setting doesn't (see below).

What this project gives you, beyond each tool's retention:

- **A durable, separate copy.** Cumulative: once backed up, a conversation is
  **never deleted from your copy**, even if the source tool removes it, you
  reinstall, or you migrate machines.
- **Works with whichever tools you use.** One tool or several — Claude Code,
  Codex, Cowork, OpenCode and Cursor — all in one place and format.
- **Something actually browsable.** Readable Markdown + a viewer with search,
  grouping, filters, analytics and review-marking — not raw `.jsonl`/SQLite.

The point: **keep it safe, browsable, and yours** — so months later you can find
why you did something, or pick up a thread where you left off, instead of losing
it to a tool's retention window.

And since it's your private data, **everything runs locally**: the scripts only
read your files and write Markdown to your disk, the viewer is a static HTML
file. No server, no cloud, no telemetry. (See [Privacy](#privacy).)

---

## How it compares

trailkeep grew out of the same idea as YC's **Paxel** — making sense of your
Claude Code / Codex / Cursor sessions — but with the opposite default on your
data. Paxel runs its analysis locally yet **uploads derived data** to YC (prompt
excerpts, file paths, commit metadata, narratives) to build an online profile; a
community security audit found it sending more than advertised, and the launch
promo was pulled amid the privacy backlash ([audit](https://www.gate.com/news/detail/y-combinators-paxel-ai-tool-claims-local-analysis-but-security-audit-21668126),
[coverage](https://digg.com/ai/urogjb9u)).

trailkeep is **self-hosted and offline** — it only reads your local files and
writes local Markdown. Nothing, raw or derived, leaves your machine.

| | trailkeep | Paxel |
|---|---|---|
| Data leaving your machine | **None** | Derived data uploaded to YC |
| Hosting | Self-hosted / offline | Cloud (YC) |
| Cadence | **Ongoing** — runs daily, incremental & cumulative | One-shot snapshot |
| Output | A living Markdown archive + browsable viewer | One-shot online "builder profile" |
| Open source | Yes (MIT) | No |

---

## What it does

- **Incremental, cumulative backup.** Only processes what's new or changed since
  the last run. Never deletes already-generated markdowns, even if the source
  tool removes the original conversation.
- **Markdown conversion.** Each session becomes a `.md` with title, date, id,
  project and source, and separated turns (`### You` / `### Claude`, etc.).
- **Portable history.** Because it's plain Markdown, you can copy a whole
  conversation (the viewer has a one-click button) and paste it into a *different*
  model or tool to continue with full context — your history isn't locked to one
  vendor.
- **Standalone HTML viewer** (`viewer.html`). Opens with a double-click
  (`file://`), no server. Groups by source or project, colors by tool, filters
  archived and reviewed, copies per turn or whole conversation, marks
  conversations as reviewed (progress exportable/importable as JSON), shows the
  run history and an **analytics** view (GitHub-style daily heatmap, top
  projects, activity over time by day/week/month, toggling conversations/turns).
  Bilingual UI (EN/ES).
- **Daily automatic backup** via `launchd` (optional).

> Cursor/OpenCode use XDG paths (`~/.config/Cursor…`, `~/.local/share/opencode…`);
> Cowork is macOS-only and skipped.

### Not supported (and why)

- **Antigravity** — stores sessions in a proprietary protobuf format with no
  public schema, so there's no stable way to parse them.
- **claude.ai** (the web app) — conversations live in Anthropic's cloud, not on
  your disk, so there's nothing local to back up.

---

## Install

Requires **macOS or Linux** and **Python 3** (ships with macOS; preinstalled on
most Linux distros).

### Quick start: let your coding agent do it

Since you already use an AI coding tool, the fastest path is to let it set
trailkeep up for you. Clone the repo (or paste the URL), then give your agent
(Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, …) this prompt:

```text
Set up trailkeep in this repository for me. It's a local, offline backup +
viewer for AI-coding-tool conversations. Please:
1. Read README.md and `./update-backup.sh --help` to understand the flags.
2. `chmod +x update-backup.sh *.command`.
3. Run a first backup with `./update-backup.sh` and report how many
   conversations each source produced.
4. If it looks good, install the daily automatic task by running
   `./install-auto.command` (ask me first if you're unsure of the time).
5. Tell me how to open viewer.html and point it at the backup folder.

Hard rule: everything stays local. Don't add any network calls, don't commit
my conversations (they're gitignored on purpose), and don't send my data
anywhere.
```

### Optional: project review automation with your agent

trailkeep itself does not call models. The next layer is a coding-agent skill you
can install into your own agent: it reads new or changed project context, follows
repo planning docs first (`ROADMAP.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, `TODO.md`,
`docs/product-progress.md`, `docs/design.md`, `design.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or
equivalents), and writes local sidecars in the backup folder.

The stable contract for that optional layer lives in
[`docs/generative-layer.md`](docs/generative-layer.md). The viewer's setup prompt
is intentionally short and tells your coding agent to follow that spec.

The output layers are cumulative: `_conversation_summaries.json` summarizes each
conversation by session id, `_project_reviews.json` combines repo docs and
conversation summaries by project, and `_agent_profile.json` captures recurring
preferences/patterns across projects. The optional automation should also append
`_review_update_log.json` so the viewer can show when generated sidecars changed.
Optional drafts such as
`AGENTS.generated.md` or `CLAUDE.generated.md` should be written to the backup
folder, not directly into a repo unless you explicitly ask.

Daily project pulse, daily design-system pulse, and global priority synthesis
update only changed projects by default. If your agent uses a remote LLM
provider, that optional automation may send the selected project context to that
provider; trailkeep's backup scripts and viewer remain local and zero-network.

Every backup run writes a local `_review_run_plan.json`: selected projects,
selected repo docs/conversation ids, why each input is needed, estimated
chars/words/tokens, intended model tier, remote-provider risk, and the local
sidecars the optional agent layer should write. If selected context contains a
possible secret, trailkeep writes a local `_review_preprocessed_inputs.json`
with only the suspected value redacted, so the conversation can still be used
without sending that value. trailkeep also writes `_review_eval_report.json`
with deterministic checks for the plan: schema, manifest coverage, no full
backup-folder dumps, basic privacy/secret flags, token-estimate sanity,
repo-doc precedence, incrementality, and output sidecar scope. The viewer shows
the per-project plan summary in Project Home.

The repo includes a versioned skill at
`skills/trailkeep-project-review/SKILL.md`. The optional agent automation should
consume the plan before any model call and run the wrapper gate:
`scripts/run-project-review-agent-gates.sh --skill-dir <skill_dir> pre --backup-dir
<backup_dir>`.
Only exit code `0` may proceed to model calls, and the agent must use
`_review_effective_plan.json` as the allowed context. Exit `0` can be partial:
flagged projects are skipped and logged as pending while safe projects continue.
Exit `2` means no safe project work remains without user approval. If the agent
cannot route models per task but can choose one automation model, use the
`strong` tier by default. If it cannot choose a model at all, continue with the
available model and write `model_routing: "unavailable"`. After writing
generated sidecars, it should run the wrapper finalizer:
`scripts/run-project-review-agent-gates.sh --skill-dir <skill_dir> finalize
--backup-dir <backup_dir>`. That writes
`_review_generated_eval_report.json`, appends `_review_update_log.json`, and
validates schema, referential integrity, checkpoints, repo-doc precedence,
privacy/secret leakage, stable task ids, evidence grounding, actionability,
tool-evidence policy, instruction-context policy, semantic quality sampling, and update-log status. A
failing finalizer means the agent review run must not be marked `ok`.
For development, `node scripts/test-generated-review-evals.cjs` runs local
fixtures that exercise those generated-output evals.

When those optional sidecars exist, the viewer reads them locally: conversation
summaries appear inside each conversation, project reviews appear in Project
Home, the global agent profile appears in Analytics with copy buttons for
generated `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` drafts, and `_review_update_log.json`
appears in Runs plus the affected Project Homes.

Prefer to do it by hand? Follow the steps below.

**1. Get the code** — clone it (or download the ZIP from the green **Code**
button on GitHub and unzip it):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucasgday/trailkeep.git
cd trailkeep
```

**2. Make the scripts executable:**

```bash
chmod +x update-backup.sh *.command
```

### Run the backup by hand

```bash
./update-backup.sh
```

By default the base is the folder where the script lives. You can pass another
path as the first argument to store the markdowns elsewhere:

```bash
./update-backup.sh ~/my-backups
```

**Options** (run `./update-backup.sh --help` for the full list):

```bash
./update-backup.sh --only claude,codex   # only some sources
./update-backup.sh --dry-run             # preview what would change, write nothing
```

You can also **double-click** `update-backup.command`.

### Enable the automatic backup (daily, 12:00)

Double-click `install-auto.command` (macOS) — or run it from the terminal. It
installs a daily task: a **`launchd`** agent on macOS, a **`cron`** entry on Linux.
By default it runs every day at noon.

Prefer a different time (or on Linux)? Run it from the terminal with an hour (24h):

```bash
./install-auto.command 22       # every day at 22:00
./install-auto.command 7:30     # every day at 07:30
```

To remove it: double-click (or run) `uninstall-auto.command`.

> On Linux, cron does **not** catch up runs missed while the machine was off
> (macOS launchd does, on wake).

## Using the viewer

Open **`viewer.html`** with a double-click (it opens in your browser as
`file://`) and point it at the folder with your `markdown-*` backups (the same
base folder). From there you can browse, filter, copy and see the analytics.

By default it groups by **project**, hides archived and already-reviewed
conversations, and opens the most recent active conversation. You can change the
grouping (by tool), the filters and the **language (EN/ES)** from the top bar /
sidebar.

## Privacy

- **Nothing leaves your machine.** The scripts only read local files and write
  local Markdown; the viewer is a static HTML file you open with `file://`. No
  network calls, no server, no telemetry.
- **The repo includes NO conversations.** The `.gitignore` excludes all markdown
  folders, the raw data (`*.jsonl`, `*.db`, `*.vscdb`, `*.pb`) and the sync
  state. Everyone backs up **their own** conversations locally; real content is
  never committed.
- **Even the hosted demo uploads nothing.** GitHub Pages only serves static HTML;
  any folder you open is read in your browser via the File API and never sent
  anywhere — the viewer makes zero network calls. That said, a hosted page is
  fetched fresh each visit, so for real, everyday use prefer the local
  `viewer.html` (`file://`): it's fixed and fully inspectable.

---

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for where it's headed — per-conversation summaries,
agent-powered project reviews, a recommended `AGENTS.md` from your own history,
Windows support. The backup and viewer stay local; optional AI layers run through
the model/provider you configure in your own agent.

---

## Contributing

**Suggestions and contributions are welcome** — especially to **support more
AI-coding tools**. If the one you use stores its sessions on disk and isn't on
the list, open an *issue* or send a *pull request*.

Adding a new source is small: you just need a converter that reads that origin
and writes the same standard Markdown the others do —

```
# <title>

<!-- date: <ISO> | id: <id> | project: <project> | source: <source> | archived: <true|false> -->

### You

…

### <Assistant>

…
```

Once the converter produces that format, the viewer and the rest of the flow
pick it up without changes. Look at any of the `converters/convert_*.py` files as
a reference. Bug reports, viewer improvements and ideas in general are welcome too.

Working on trailkeep with an AI agent? See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the
conventions and the one hard rule: the viewer makes **zero network calls**.
To verify canonical prompt copies stayed in sync, run:
`node scripts/check-prompt-drift.cjs`.
For optional viewer QA, install/cache Playwright Chromium and run:
`node scripts/verify-viewer.cjs`. This is a dev check only; the backup does not
depend on it.

---

## Notes

- **macOS & Linux.** Source paths are resolved per-OS (macOS app-support paths;
  XDG `~/.config` / `~/.local/share` on Linux) and the daily task uses `launchd`
  on macOS or `cron` on Linux. **Windows** isn't supported. Cowork is macOS-only
  (no official Linux Claude desktop), so it's simply skipped on Linux.
